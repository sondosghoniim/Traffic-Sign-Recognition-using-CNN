# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-using-CNN


##  Project Overview

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify traffic signs from images into one of **43 classes**. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of traffic signs, enabling it to accurately predict the type of traffic sign present in a given image. This project simulates how self-driving cars or smart traffic systems might recognize road signs in real time.

The project also includes a simple **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** to allow users to upload an image and receive a classification result.

## ðŸ§  Features & Objectives

- Build and train a CNN on traffic sign image data
- Achieve high classification accuracy across 43 categories
- Provide a GUI for interactive image classification
- Display performance metrics like confusion matrix, precision, and F1-score

##  Dataset

The dataset consists of:
- **Training data**: Labeled images for 43 different traffic sign classes
- **Test data**: A CSV file containing image paths and labels

Each image is resized to **30x30 pixels** and converted into NumPy arrays for model input.
